# Dataset
At the moment there is no dataset available in this directory.
## How to use utilities.py
Make sure to have your unsplitted dataset in `../training_data_final` folder. The dataset folder should be organized in subfolders,
each one containing pictures of a specific class.\
Run `utilities.py` to generate a split training set(80%) and  validation set(20%) in the `../` directory. Furthermore, the script will generate
a training_oversampled directory which contains duplicates of minority classes.\
